//! Shared pulse clock for the repeating loaders.
//!
//! A repeating `with_animation` element requests a redraw every display frame
//! for as long as it is mounted — one working row pinned the whole window at
//! 120 Hz on a ProMotion panel. Loaders instead read their phase from one
//! shared clock: it ticks at up to 60 fps, notifies only views that painted a
//! loader recently, and parks itself once the last lease lapses, so a window
//! with no loader mounted schedules nothing at all. Every loader shares one
//! epoch, keeping multi-instance loaders phase-locked.
