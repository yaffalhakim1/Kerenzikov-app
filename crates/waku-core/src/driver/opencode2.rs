//! OpenCode 2 sessions over the one adopted background service.
//!
//! Everything structural about this driver follows from a single fact: Waku
//! does not own an OpenCode 2 process. `opencode2_service` finds the daemon
//! the user's own terminal already started, and every Waku task rides the one
//! `GET /api/event` stream it exposes. So this file has no server handle, no
//! process teardown and no exit budget — dropping a driver unsubscribes and
//! sends `Shutdown`, and that is the whole of it.
//!
//! The second structural change from v1 is that commands and events land in
//! ONE worker thread driven by `crossbeam::select!`. All mutable stream state
//! is therefore thread-local: v1's `Arc<OpenCodeStreamState>`,
//! `Arc<Mutex<OpenCodePermissionState>>` and `Arc<Mutex<bool>>` turn flag all
//! disappear, and so does its per-session usage-metadata poller — context
//! windows come from the service-level catalogue cache.
//!
//! Three traps are encoded here rather than left to a reader to remember:
//!
//! * **The execution outcome is the settle point.** `session.execution.`
//!   `{succeeded,failed,interrupted}` ends the turn and emits exactly one
//!   `TurnFinished`; settling is idempotent, so a steered second message —
//!   which joins the running execution rather than starting its own — still
//!   settles once. Do NOT wait for `session.idle`: 0.0.0-beta-19192 does not
//!   emit it (verified against a live turn; the stream ends at
//!   `session.execution.*` and nothing follows), and waiting for it pins every
//!   finished turn to Working forever. A prompt whose HTTP call fails settles
//!   the turn itself, because no execution ever starts.
//! * **A stream break is never `ProcessExited`.** v1 ends its reader by
//!   reporting the process gone; for an adopted service that would kill a
//!   perfectly healthy session every time the socket blinked. Reconnection is
//!   the service's job and arrives here as `HubFrame::Resync`.
//! * **`always` never goes on the wire.** An `always` reply writes into
//!   `/api/permission/saved`, a GLOBAL store shared with the user's terminal
//!   and every other workspace, so durable choices stay in this driver's own
//!   state and every provider reply is one-shot. See `driver::support`.
//!
//! Everything in this file blocks on sockets and runs on the worker thread or
//! a daemon request thread. Nothing here is reachable from a frame.
