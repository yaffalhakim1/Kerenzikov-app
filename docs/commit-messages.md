# Commit-message generation

When the commit dialog's message box is left empty, Waku generates the subject
line by running **the session's own agent CLI** once, headlessly. No coding
agent exposes a commit-message endpoint and Waku holds no provider API key, so
the CLI binary is the only route to a model.

Every provider gets the same prompt. The only per-provider code is the argument
vector that puts its CLI into a one-shot, tool-free mode
([`agent_arguments`](../crates/waku-core/src/git_commit.rs#L210)).

## Which model

A commit subject is a fixed classification over a diff that is already in the
prompt, so it does not need the model the task runs on. Where a provider names a
cheap tier, generation is **pinned** to it at the lowest effort that tier's API
accepts, whatever the session selected — the same reasoning that puts Codex
titles on `gpt-5.6-luna` ([titles.md](titles.md)):

| Provider | Model | Effort | How |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `claude-haiku-4-5` | `low` | `--model` / `--effort`; `low` is the floor `--effort` accepts |
| Codex CLI | `gpt-5.6-luna` | `none` | `--model`, plus `-c model_reasoning_effort="none"` — `codex exec` has no effort flag |

`none` is genuinely the floor for Codex: `minimal` comes back as a 400
`unsupported_value` naming `none, low, medium, high, xhigh, max` as the
supported set for this model.

Every other provider still runs on the session's own selection, captured when
the dialog opens into an
[`AgentInvocation`](../crates/waku-protocol/src/git.rs#L45) alongside the probed
binary path ([commit_dialog.rs:129](../src/app/commit_dialog.rs#L129)):

| Field | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `model` | [`model_for_session`](../src/app/runtime.rs#L1492) — the session's explicit model, else the provider probe's preferred model (the one flagged `is_default`, else the first discovered) |
| `reasoning_effort` | the session's own `reasoning_effort`, verbatim |

Both are `Option`, and a `None` omits the flag, leaving the CLI on its own
default. Two providers drop part of that by having nowhere to put it:
**DeepSeek** is passed no model flag at all, so it always runs whatever
`--profile headless` resolves to, and **Cursor** takes a model but no effort
flag.

## The prompt

[`commit_prompt`](../crates/waku-core/src/git_commit.rs#L173) builds it from Git
alone — no transcript, no session history:

| Include unstaged | Status | Diff |
| --- | --- | --- |
| off | `git diff --cached --name-status` | `git diff --cached` |
| on (default) | `git status --short --untracked-files=all` | `git diff --cached`, then `git diff` under its own heading |

Diffs run `--no-ext-diff --no-color`. The context is capped at 96 KiB, cut on a
UTF-8 boundary and marked `[diff truncated]`, which also adds a sentence telling
the model to summarize only what it can still see. Then:

```
Generate a concise Git commit subject for the changes below.
Return exactly one line and nothing else: no quotes, Markdown, prefix, explanation, or trailing period.
Use imperative mood and at most 72 characters. Do not call tools; all context is included here.
```

## Per provider

Same prompt, same pipeline. Unless noted, the prompt is the **last positional
argument**; `NO_COLOR=1` and `CI=1` are set for all of them.

| Provider | Command | Headless / tool-free flags | Model | Effort |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Amp | `amp` | `--execute --no-color --no-ide --no-notifications --settings-file <temp>` | `--mode` | `--effort` |
| Claude Code | `claude` | `--print --output-format text --permission-mode plan --tools "" --disable-slash-commands --no-session-persistence --no-chrome` | pinned `claude-haiku-4-5` | pinned `low` |
| Codex CLI | `codex exec` | `--sandbox read-only --ephemeral --color never --skip-git-repo-check` | pinned `gpt-5.6-luna` | pinned `none`, via `-c` |
| Copilot CLI | `copilot` | `--prompt <prompt> --silent --no-color` | `--model` | — |
| Cursor CLI | `cursor-agent` | `--print --output-format text --mode ask --sandbox enabled --trust` | `--model` | — |
| DeepSeek Harness | `dsh` | `--profile headless` | — | — |
| Fx | `fx ask` | `--no-save --no-color --` | — | — |
| OpenCode | `opencode run` | `--pure --agent plan` | `--model` | `--variant` |
| Grok Build | `grok` | `--single <prompt> --output-format plain --permission-mode plan --tools "" --no-memory --no-subagents --disable-web-search --verbatim` | `--model` | `--reasoning-effort` |
| Pi | `pi` | `--print --no-session --no-tools --no-context-files --no-extensions --no-skills --no-prompt-templates --no-approve` | `--model` | `--thinking` |
| Oh My Pi | `omp` | `--print --no-session --no-tools --no-rules --no-extensions --no-skills` | `--model` | `--thinking` |
| Kimi Code | `kimi` | `--prompt <prompt> --output-format text` | `--model` | — |

Where a provider is not simply "flags plus prompt":

- **Amp** has no flag that disables tools, so Waku writes a throwaway settings
  file to the temp directory —
  `{"amp.tools.enable":[],"amp.notifications.enabled":false,"amp.skills.disableClaudeCodeSkills":true}`
  — passes it with `--settings-file`, and deletes it afterwards, including on
  the error path ([git_commit.rs:90](../crates/waku-core/src/git_commit.rs#L90)).
  Its model selector is a *mode*, hence `--mode`.
- **Claude Code** runs in `plan` permission mode with an empty `--tools` list,
  and `--no-session-persistence` keeps the run out of `~/.claude/projects`,
  where it would look like a task the user started. Haiku exposes no reasoning
  tiers in Waku's catalog, but the CLI still accepts `--effort low` for it.
- **Codex** runs `exec` as an ephemeral read-only turn; `--skip-git-repo-check`
  lets a workspace that is not a repo root run. Effort rides on a `-c` config
  override because `codex exec` has no flag for it.
- **Cursor** has no tool switch either; `--mode ask` is its read-only answer
mode, `--sandbox enabled` the backstop, and `--trust` suppresses the
workspace-trust prompt that would block a piped run.
- **Copilot** is the third exception to prompt-last alongside Grok and Kimi:
`--prompt` takes the prompt as its value, so the function returns early
rather than appending it twice. It has no tool switch to turn off, so the
prompt's "do not call tools" is the whole guard, as with DeepSeek; `--silent`
keeps the output to the message. Prompt mode exposes no thinking-level flag,
hence no effort column.
- **DeepSeek** gets only `--profile headless`, Harness's one-shot stdout-only
  client. It has no tool switch — the prompt's "do not call tools" is the whole
  guard, which holds because all context is inlined.
- **Grok** is the exception to prompt-last: the prompt is the value of
  `--single` and the function returns early, so it is never appended twice
  ([git_commit.rs:303](../crates/waku-core/src/git_commit.rs#L303)).
  `--verbatim` stops the CLI re-wrapping the answer; `--no-memory` keeps a
  commit subject out of Grok's long-term memory.
- **Kimi** is the other exception to prompt-last: `--prompt` takes the prompt as
  its value, so the function returns early rather than appending it twice. It
  has no tool, session, or context switch to turn off, and `--plan` — its
  read-only mode — is rejected outright when combined with `--prompt`, so the
  prompt's "do not call tools" is the whole guard, as with DeepSeek. Prompt mode
  exposes no thinking-level flag, hence no effort column.
- **Oh My Pi** rejects unknown flags outright, so it gets its own list rather
  than Pi's: context files are `--no-rules`, and it has no prompt-template or
  project-trust switch to turn off.
- **Pi** needs the long list because each capability is its own switch.
  `--no-context-files` is its "disable `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` discovery"
  flag, so repo instructions cannot contradict the fixed prompt.

`every_provider_uses_a_noninteractive_generation_mode`
([git_commit.rs:691](../crates/waku-core/src/git_commit.rs#L691)) walks
`ProviderKind::ALL` and asserts each of these, so a new provider cannot be added
without choosing its headless shape.
`claude_and_codex_generate_on_a_pinned_cheap_tier` guards the pins by passing
`claude-opus-5` / `gpt-5.6-sol` and asserting neither reaches the CLI.

## Normalizing the output

CLIs disagree about what "one line and nothing else" means — preamble lines,
code fences, ANSI under `NO_COLOR`. [`normalize_message`](../crates/waku-core/src/git_commit.rs#L349)
strips ANSI, drops empty lines, bare ``` fences and `[tool]` / `[thinking]`
lines, takes the **last** surviving line, then strips backticks, a
`Commit message:` / `Commit subject:` prefix, wrapping quotes and a trailing
period, and caps at 200 characters. Empty means failure, reported as
`<Provider> returned no commit message`.

Taking the last line makes the result a subject only: a model that returns a
subject, blank line, and body has the body discarded.
